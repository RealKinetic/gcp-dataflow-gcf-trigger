# gcp-dataflow-gcf-trigger

Trigger a Dataflow job when a file is uploaded to Cloud Storage using a Cloud Function.
This can be used to trigger Dataprep flows from Cloud Storage (or other) events. For
triggering Dataprep flows using the Dataprep API rather than Dataflow, see
[gcp-dataprep-gcf-trigger](https://github.com/RealKinetic/gcp-dataprep-gcf-trigger).
